# What?

Kotlin implementation of a simple lisp inspired by https://norvig.com/lispy.html

# How?

Start by running Hello World:

`./gradlew run --args src/main/lisp/sample/HelloWorld.lisp`

Experiment with a read-eval-print loop (REPL):

`./gradlew -q --console=plain repl`

# Why?

Urr, I didn't expect anybody to read this far.

Because it's fun?
